very simple online playground for visually creating web applications

GOALS:

- [ ] UX similar to regular browsers
  - [ ] right click inspect element (source code though)
- [ ] built extensions API for windows to hook into
- [ ] developing a language that is optimial for visual development, not hand writing.
  - [ ] visual first, hand-writing second. 

IMMEDIATE:

- [ ] vscode extension

MVP:

- [ ] dev server for playground (window that manages all other windows)
- [ ] DSL for dynamic templates
- [ ] dev environment for playground
  - [ ] CLI `paperclip-dev-server [ROOT]`
  - [ ] master window which opens all `*.pc` files in directory
  - [ ] pc files can be accessed via `/files/[relative file pathÂ from root]`
  - [ ] `PATCH` to `/files/*` updates cache
  - [ ] `POST` to `/persist` saves cache
  - [ ] reload each window when assoc file changes
  - [ ] each window uses SystemJS
  - [ ] master window has window presets (radio buttons for desktop, tablets, etc)
  - [ ] master window has `meta=no-tools` tag so that users can interact with page
  - [ ] each window reloads itself (in case they're used outside of the app)
  - [ ] get to work with template based languages (vue, glimmer)

- POLISH:

- [ ] ability to zoom in from full screen mode

- [ ] ability to to open window outside of Playground
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts by browser - http://dmcritchie.mvps.org/firefox/keyboard.htm
   - [ ] ctrl+shift+{} to tab between windows
- [ ] tab between windows (cmd+shift+{)
- [ ] zoom indicator
- [ ] measurement tooling
- [ ] highlight elements based on text cursor position
- [ ] multi select
- [ ] copy + paste elements
- [ ] meta keywords for controlling UI
  - [ ] `<meta name="no-tools" />`
  - [ ] `<meta name="device=ios5" />` for ios tool overlay
  - [ ] `<meta name="background-task" />` hides window from stage
- [ ] AWS lambda for rendering
- [ ] persisting to local storage needs to reload sibling windows

HI PRIO:

- [ ] move style to class shortcut
- [ ] CSS inspector

CLEANUP:

- [ ] file cache namespaced to workspace
- [ ] normalize urls - http://site.com/ -> http://site.com
- [ ] cannot multi dnd windows
- [ ] secondary selection (double click) should reselect item that was clicked
- [ ] use old DOM rendering code
- [ ] synthetic window timers
- [ ] HMR directly in window
- [ ] resizing elements
- [ ] keep measurements when resizing

Immediate TODOS:

UIs:

- [ ] 

MVP:

- save workspace online

After validating:

- remote renderer
